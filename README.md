<h1>Welcome to the Server Diagnostic Centre</h1>

<p><i>Version 1.0 released on 17th June 2013 by Dave Collier</i></p>

<p>The Server Diagnostic Centre is a collection of tools designed to collect and display server and process level metrics (ie. % CPU utilisation data, % memory utilisation data) from multiple servers.</p>

<p>Write your own scripts to collect various server level and process level metrics and then use this tool to display them graphically and more importantly provide a link between the two data sets.</p>

<p>In this particular instance I am collecting cpu, memory, disk, network in and network out utilisation metrics at the server level and cpu, memory, disk and process thread count utilisation metrics at the process level.</p>

<p>This data is loaded into a SQL database from which web based tools have been developed to graphically display and analyse the data for the purposes of trend analysis, capacity management, performance comparisons over time and incident / diagnostic analysis.</p>
